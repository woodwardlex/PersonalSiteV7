                    <p>
                        Job Board is my final project website at Centriq that I had created in 8 days under the supervision of a Centriq instructor, who was acting as the client and the project manager. My goal was to create an easy-to-use navigational experience while keeping a consistent look and feel throughout the whole site.

                        This website was pair-programmed by myself and my classmate Kolby Williams. Using only one computer, we gained the communication skills to go through daily sprints as well documentation of our project. This exercise was helpful in allowing us to become more comfortable with working alongside a partner.

                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
