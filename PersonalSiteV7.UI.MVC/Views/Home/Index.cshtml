                Most of my prior experience consists of customer service and problem-solving. This experience has taught me how to work collaboratively in a team aspect and to always think outside of the box when solving issues. Starting my job experience as a Soccer Referee, I learned how to be make quick and accurate decisions. While working in the food insudtry as a waitress, I gained confidence in my communication and orgainizational skills when I spoke with customers and coworkers.

                My goal is to be able to build programs and websites that are accessible to people who feel as though they struggle when they use websites. I strive for better communication between businesses and customers, of all ages, through understandable programming and user-friendly accessibility.
